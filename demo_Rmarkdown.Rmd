## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r gapminder_data}
gap.in <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
summary (gap.in)


# install dplyr
install.packages('dplyr')
library('dplyr')

gap.in %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Angola", "Japan", "United States")) %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap)
  group_by(country)
  
Angola <- gap.in$country == "Angola" 
  plot(gap.in$year[Angola], gap.in$gdpPercap[Angola])

Japan <- gap.in$country == "Japan"
  plot(gap.in$year[Japan], gap.in$gdpPercap[Japan])

United_States <- gap.in$country == "United States"
  plot(gap.in$year[United_States], gap.in$gdpPercap[United_States])
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
